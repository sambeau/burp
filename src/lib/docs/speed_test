make an automatic script that 

 * picks an abritrary number for a setting eg 1
 * compiles
 * does a number of timed runs to get an average 
 * it then doubles the number and does it again
   * if it's faster it repeats the process
   * if it's slower it tries again at half the difference

eg a binary search on a setting to find the fastest setting
